# Minesweeper AI Plan

## Approach for Scanning the Screen and Identifying Tiles Based on Pixel Color

1. Capture the screen using the `Pillow` library.
2. Extract the region of interest (the Minesweeper game board) from the captured image.
3. Analyze the pixel colors within the extracted region to identify the state of each tile (e.g., covered, uncovered, mine, number).
4. Use predefined color values for each tile state to match the pixel colors and determine the tile state.

## File Structure and Modules Required for Implementation

- `main.py`: The main entry point for the AI.
- `screen_capture.py`: Module for capturing the screen and extracting the region of interest.
- `tile_identification.py`: Module for analyzing pixel colors and identifying tile states.
- `mouse_control.py`: Module for controlling the mouse to interact with the game.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for common tasks.

## Image Processing Techniques to Analyze the Screen

1. Convert the captured image to a format suitable for analysis using `OpenCV`.
2. Apply image processing techniques (e.g., color thresholding, contour detection) to identify the tiles and their states.
3. Use predefined color values for each tile state to match the pixel colors and determine the tile state.

## Libraries to be Used

- `Pillow` for capturing the screen.
- `OpenCV` for image processing.
- `pyautogui` for mouse control to interact with the game.
